Notes

Section 1:
-----------

MySQL is most widely used database

there are two types of databases 
1.SQL database
2.NoSQL database

Why relational DB, when NoSQL are getting popular?
-> It does not mean when one thing is getting popular then there is dip in older thing.


MySQL is one of the foundational DB.
MariaDB is on of the close competitor for MySQL

In this lectures we are using local installation.

To lean DB is not as fun as building app in react, python or flutter.

Without DB you will always feel half confident.



Section 2:
----------

In this section we will play fictitious scenario and we will try to learn some basic operations.

------------------------------------------------------------
#Task 1.1:
You want to have a startup. Initial thought was to name it click store. Then you decided to name it photo store. 
Create DB accordingly.
------------------------------------------------------------
*** mysql -u root -p - this command is used to start MySQL on cmd when you hit this command it will ask you for the password for root user.

*** show databases; - this command will show you the the database and first time it will come with bydefault values.

*** CREATE DATABASE click_store; : this command will create a new data base and we can verify it by using show databases command.

now we want to change the name from click_store to photo_store.
There is no direct way to do that, first of all we need to delete click_store and create new data_base named as photo_store.

*** DROP database click_store - this command will delete  the data base. Make sure whatever you want to delete you mention it after drop,
In this example we mentioned database because we want to delete database.


*** source one_basic.sql command can be used to run the tasks directly from .sql file. We can do it on VScode as well.


In this course we are using VS code because it will serve us well to write queries and edit them afterwards. And with this written queries in VS code will help us to refer the codes afterwards.


-----------------------------------------------------------
#Task 1.2:
In store, I will keep canon cameras. I will keep stock information by camera name and quantity.
-----------------------------------------------------------

To select the required database first run the command;
USE database_name;
SELECT DATABASE();

***To create the table camera we use following command.
CREATE TABLE cameras(
	model_name VARCHAR(30),
	quantity INT
);

***To see the table we use describe command
DESC cameras;

***SHOW TABLES; this command is used to see the all available tables in database.



------------------------------------------------------------
#Task 1.3:
A shipment of canon cameras came in and you have to add them in database.
70D - 12
80D - 19
EOS-R - 25
EOS-r5 - 80
EOS-r6 - 50
------------------------------------------------------------

***To insert data in table we are using following command:

INSERT INTO canon_cameras(model_name, quantity)
VALUES("70-D", 12),
("80-D", 19),
("EOS-R", 25),
("EOS-r5", 80),
("EOS-r6", 50);



------------------------------------------------------------
#Task 1.4
A customer walks in the store and asks following questions:
1. What model of canon cameras do you have?
2. How much 80D you can give me right now?
3. I want to buy buy 50 cameras of same model. What can you supply me at this moment?
------------------------------------------------------------

***To get all information from our canon_cameras table we can use command:
SELECT * FROM canon_cameras;


***If you want to grab all model names of canon_cameras from database then you can use command:
SELECT model_name FROM canon_cameras;

***To answer the second question we need to use WERE clause with this we can select that specific model_name and get it's data.
SELECT model_name, quantity FROM canon_cameras
WHERE model_name = "80d";
now look at d it is not case sensitive here.


SELECT model_name, quantity FROM canon_cameras
WHERE quantity >= 50;


section: 3
===========

This section is like replica of what we seen in past section but things are different here.
In this section we will learn about the null values, primary keys, default values 
This are base foundations of relational database.


---------------------------------------------------------------
#Task 1.5
 
 Where we are now:
 Coustomers are coming in the store and we wan to store our customers data.

 I want to store their name, email and amount they spent.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Primary Key:
============
Whenever you want to make anything or any row unique then it comes to the primary key. It is used to make naything unique

Default:
========
When someone don't want to give some value then the value which will come in that place is a default value.

Not NULL:
=========
We don't want the values in our database will come as NULL.


---------------------------------------------------------------
#Task 1.6

Where we are now?

We want to answer some of the customer questions.
1. Can you give me names of all customers?
2. Can you give me emails of all customers?
3. Can you give me all purchases of all customers?
---------------------------------------------------------------

1st and 2nd query is simple and there commands are:
SELECT name FROM customers;
SELCCT email FROM customers;

*Whatever data you retrive from data base there you will get the copy of data not exact data so aliasing help us to get data with some modeification.

for 3rd query we need to take amount as pusrchases so we use:
-------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT amount AS Purchases from customers;
In this query AS is:
An alias is a feature of SQL that is supported by most, if not all, relational database management systems (RDBMSs). A programmer can use an alias to temporarily assign another name to a table or column for the duration of a SELECT query. Assigning an alias does not actually rename the column or table.



C - CREATE
R - READ
U - UPDATE 
D - DELETE
This all are concepts not just the commands.

-Whatever we done till now are CREATE tasks

Now we are going to do UPDATE tasks.
---------------------------------------------------------------
#Task 1.7

1. Jimmy's email was entered incorrectly, edit it to jimmy@yahoo.com


2. Lina's purchase wa not of 35 but it was of 38

3. Change email of all line to lina@gmail.com

---------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:
=====
*Having primary key is the best way to select any row you want to do.
*Whenever we are doing any UPDATE operation it is recommended to perform select operation.

**SET keyword is used to set the data, whatever data is present is get overwritten by new data.


to answer 1st question we need to select the name with 1st command and then we will update it with 2nd command

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name='jimmy';

*To update data UPDATE key word is used and to set data SET keyword is used.

UPDATE customers SET email = 'jimmy@yahoo.com' WHERE name='jimmy';


in 3rd qustion we are asked to change email id of all lina with lina@gmail.com 
It is similar to the operations we performed above.


-Now further tasks are for deleting the data:
---------------------------------------------------------------
#Task 1.8

1.Delete George information
2.Delete all hitesh account
3.Delete all lina account
---------------------------------------------------------------

to delete data use following queries but first select the rows which you want to delete.

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name='george';
DELETE FROM customers WHERE name='george';

*NOTE: 
======
1. Make sure before performing delete operation you always perform a select operation and see what data you are going to delete.

***CAUTION : If you write command as 
DELETE FROM customers; 
Then you will delete entire table.



Section 4:
==========
This section is based on tasks for reading db
In this section we will learn about core foundation of MySQL

In this section we are going to learn about functions.


three_lco.sql is just to make a database to perform operations use another file. i.e. three_task.sql


---------------------------------------------------------------
#Task 2.1:
1. Give me full name of all students.
2. Give me full name and login count of all users.
3. While getting all firstname, change a to @.
4. Get me list of emails. If email is longer than 7 character, truncate it with ...
5. Get me length of all registerd email.
6. Get me all first name in upper case and last name in lower case.
---------------------------------------------------------------

*TASK FOR CONCAT:
=================
Grabbing full names is very common practice in databases.
For now try to break the query in small parts.

Now to answer the 1st question we want full name as always we can take stu_fname and stu_lname seprately but 
here we have a better way to take it using concatination.

SELECT CONCAT(stu_fname, ' ', stu_lname) AS stu_fullName FROM students;


*TASK FOR REPLACE:
==================
SELECT REPLACE('Atharva', 'a', '@');
^this query will replace a's in my name with @'s.
This time it is case sensitive only small a's will get affected capital A will remain as it is.



SUBSTRINGS:
===========
In the substrings eg. SELECT SUBSTRING('ATHARVA', 1, 4);
here it will give me an output : ATHA
The 1 denotes that start from first postion(Here we will start string from 1 not from 0.)
& 4 indicates to take 4 values from string.
If you missout this 4 then all values get printed.

*Query for 4th question is:
SELECT CONCAT(REPLACE(email, 1, 7), '...') AS trucared_email from students;



REVERSE:
========
SELECT REVERSE(stu_fname) FROM students;
This will give all names in reverse.


CHAR_LENGTH:
============
SELECT email, CHAR_LENGTH(email) AS length FROM students;
This will give us the length of characters.


UPPER CASE AND LOWER CASE:
==========================
SELECT UPPER('atharva');
this will give us ATHARVA as a output.

SELECT LOWER('ATHARVA');
THIS WILL GIVE US atharva AS A OUTPUT.



Section: 5
==========
This section is strong foundation
Until we learned basics now in this section we will learn how to perform operations.

Documentation reading is important for this section.


--------------------------------------------------
Task 3.1 LCO USERS - Level - 2

1. How many users are there on your website?
2.1 Arrange all user based on number of login count.
2.2 Arrange all user based on number of course count.
3. I want sorted result but only top 5 users.
4. Find the users who's names are ending with esh.
5. How many users are registered on website. Give me number this time.
6. Group students by signup month.
7. Find student with max login and also find the one with min course count.
8. Lowest number of login count in 7th and 10th month.
9. Total number of login and average number of course taken by users by month.
10. Find users who are having login count of least 20 and are enrolled in at least 5 courses.
11. Find users who signed up in 7th and 10th month(In the question AND is given but it does not mean we should use AND We need to Use OR here otherwise it will does not give any output.)

--------------------------------------------------



DISTINCT:
=========
In our data base mukesh and hemant are repeated so to grab only one or unique from them we use distinct key word.

eg.
SELECT DISTINCT stu_fname, email FROM students;


ORDER BY:
=========
With the help of this query we can arrange our data in asscending or descending order.

***It is bydefault in ascending order to print it in descending order we need to write the DESC keyword.

SELECT stu_fname, login_count, course_count 
FROM students ORDER BY login_count;

SELECT stu_fname, login_count, course_count 
FROM students ORDER BY login_count ASC;

SELECT stu_fname, login_count, course_count 
FROM students ORDER BY login_count DESC;

***We can also write query with the number of column. In following query elements will get printed according to 3rd column.

SELECT stu_fname, login_count, course_count 
FROM students ORDER BY 3 DESC;


LIMIT:
======
Following query will give us only top 5 results.
SELECT DISTINCT stu_fname, login_count
FROM students ORDER BY login_count DESC LIMIT 0, 5;

Here 0 means rows start from 0. Yes it is not same as substring here we start from 0.
And 5 means 5 results.


MATCH THE PATTERN:
==================
LIKE:
=====
Here we want to find all the users who's names will end with esh.

SELECT stu_fname, email FROM students
WHERE stu_fname LIKE "%esh";

This % sign will denote that match the string with esh and take naything before that.

Similarly if we want all name starting from m we will write something like "m%".

If suppse we have name mike then we can write it as "m____" or "mi__" or "m_k_" something like this.
	

COUNT:
======
To get COUNT of users we will write a query as
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT stu_fname) FROM students;

***NOTE: here we have written DISTINCT inside () to get count of unique values only.
But if we write it outside the () then we will get count with duplicate values as well.


GROUP BY:
=========
Before group by we need to set the sql mode and without setting this mode there are chances of getting errors.

SET MODE:
---------
SET @@sql_mode = '';


SELECT stu_fname, signup_month, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY signup_month;

^ This query will give us the list of students who are grouped by there signup month.
This COUNT(*) will give us the exact number of grouped students.



MIN AND MAX:
============
SELECT stu_fname, email, MIN(login_count) FROM students;

SELECT stu_fname, email, MAX(login_count) FROM students;

This both queries will give just MAX OR MIN of login count but the name and email associated  with that is wrong.

To fix that we need to fireup two queries at a time and this query will be as follows:

SELECT stu_fname, email, login_count FROM students
WHERE login_count = (SELECT MAX(login_count) FROM students);

Following query is for finding minimum course count from students.

SELECT stu_fname, email, course_count FROM students
WHERE course_count = (SELECT MIN(course_count) FROM students);


GROUP BY - MIN AND MAX:
=======================





AVG and SUM:
============
SELECT signup_month, login_count FROM students
WHERE signup_month = 7;

This is the query we already know how to grab data who's signup month is 7.

SELECT signup_month, login_count FROM students
GROUP BY signup_month;
This query will give us the the result where everything is grouped by signup month.

SELECT signup_month, SUM(login_count) FROM students
GROUP BY signup_month;

SELECT signup_month, AVG(login_count) FROM students
GROUP BY signup_month;

GROUP BY is always used with SUM or AVG or in something which is similar to this context.


AND and OR:
===========
SELECT email, login_count, signup_month, course_count FROM students
WHERE login_count >=20 AND course_count >= 5
ORDER BY login_count;

SELECT email, login_count, signup_month, course_count FROM students
WHERE login_count >=20 OR course_count >= 5
ORDER BY login_count;

SELECT email, login_count, course_count, signup_month FROM students
WHERE signup_month = 7 OR  signup_month = 10;

In the question and is given to show the entries from both months but while writing query we need to write OR otherwise it will not give any result.

SELECT email, login_count, course_count, signup_month FROM students
WHERE signup_month = 7 AND  signup_month = 10;

***RANGE - BETWEEN AND
======================
If you want to get all entries between 7 and 10 then we can write it in this way.

SELECT email, login_count, signup_month FROM students
WHERE signup_month BETWEEN 7 AND 10;


CASE:
=====
If you want to make two user groups such as early birds and regular users then we can write query in following way.

SELECT stu_fname, signup_month, 
    CASE 
        WHEN signup_month BETWEEN 7 AND 10 THEN 'EARLY BIRD'
        WHEN signup_month BETWEEN 11 AND 12 THEN 'REGULAR USER'
        ELSE '##'
    END AS Custom
FROM students;
